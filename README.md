# Maang.in AI Assistant 🤖

## 🚀 Overview
**Maang.in AI Assistant** is a powerful Chrome Extension that embeds an intelligent AI tutor directly into the [Maang.in](https://maang.in) competitive programming platform.

Powered by **Google Gemini**, this tool provides real-time, context-aware assistance.

* **💬 Persistent Chat History:** Saves your conversation for *each specific problem*. You can leave a problem and come back later; your chat will still be there.
* **🎨 Smart UI:**
    * **Draggable & Resizable:** Move the chat window anywhere on your screen so it doesn't block your code.
    * **Theme Adaptation:** Automatically syncs with Maang.in's Dark or Light mode.
* **⚡ Productivity Tools:**
    * **One-Click Copy:** Copy code snippets from the AI response instantly.
    * **Markdown Support:** Responses are formatted beautifully with syntax highlighting.
    * **Export Chat:** Download your entire study session for offline review.
